# EarnApp Review 2025: Earn Money Online by Sharing Internet Bandwidth – Is It Legit?

## What is EarnApp, and What Does It Offer?

EarnApp is a platform that allows you to earn money by installing their program and letting it run in the background on your device. It is a legitimate site that enables passive income generation. In this review, I will provide payment proof later to demonstrate its reliability.

Now, the key question is: Is it worth it? To answer this, you need to understand how it works, which involves examining its earning opportunities.

For a detailed inside look, I have created a video explaining exactly how to earn from EarnApp. You can watch it below or read the full details in this article.

## Earning Opportunities with EarnApp

### Option 1 – Sharing Your Unused Internet Bandwidth

EarnApp's primary earning method is similar to other bandwidth-sharing platforms. The program shares your unused internet bandwidth while running in the background.

#### Installation and Setup
After registering as a member, download the EarnApp software. It is compatible with Windows, Mac, and Linux computers, and there is also an Android app (more on that later).

Once installed, the program appears in your system tray. Click it to link your account, which takes just a few seconds. You can also set it to start automatically with your operating system.

#### How Earnings Work
Previously, earnings were based on the amount of data shared (pay-per-GB model). However, since August 20, 2025, EarnApp has shifted to a pay-per-time model. Earnings now depend on the duration of your device's connection and its traffic contribution, rather than data volume.

- **Rates by Location**: In the US, you can earn up to $10 per IP address per month (approximately $0.0138 per hour). Outside the US, it's up to $5 per IP address per month (about $0.0069 per hour).
- **Traffic Requirements**: To earn the full rate, your device must meet minimum traffic thresholds. Partial earnings are possible based on your contribution.

These rates are comparable to similar platforms. While not the highest, they are competitive.

#### Impact on Internet Speed
Sharing bandwidth may slightly reduce your internet speed, but it's usually unnoticeable unless you're downloading large files or gaming. You can pause the program anytime for full bandwidth access.

This method requires minimal effort—just install and let it run.

### Option 2 – Offers

EarnApp offers paid offers as a new earning opportunity. These are short tasks, often involving mobile games, where you complete missions to earn rewards.

There are typically several offers available, but they can take time to complete. Ensure you have sufficient time before starting to avoid wasting effort.

### Option 3 – Referral Program

Earn additional passive income by referring others. Share your invite link; when someone signs up, installs the software, and earns, you receive a 10% commission on their bandwidth-sharing earnings.

Note: Referrals must use a different IP address; shared IPs do not qualify for commissions.

## How Do You Get Paid?

Earnings accumulate in your EarnApp account balance, visible in the member dashboard.

Payout options include:
- **PayPal or Wise**: Minimum $2.50
- **Amazon Gift Cards**: Minimum $50 (available for select countries like US, Germany, and UK)

You can set up automatic payouts when reaching the threshold.

The payment system is straightforward, with a low threshold for PayPal and Wise. I have recorded a video showing the payout process and payment proof:

## How Much Money Can You Make?

Earnings depend on your location, device usage time, and internet bandwidth availability. You control how often the program runs, but sharing isn't constant—demand fluctuates.

While not a get-rich-quick scheme, it provides effortless income. Patience is key, as earnings are modest but require no active effort.

## Can You Use It on Mobile?

EarnApp has an Android app, but iOS support is in development. The app isn't on Google Play Store due to a false-positive detection by Google Play Protect. Download the APK manually from EarnApp's site.

The app shares mobile data bandwidth, ideal for unlimited plans. Enable it in Play Protect settings to prevent removal.

## Who Can Join EarnApp?

EarnApp is available globally. Registration is simple: use your Google account to sign up. After logging in, download and install the software, link your account, and start earning immediately.

## Can You Get Support?

Check the FAQ page for common questions. If needed, use the contact form to submit inquiries.

EarnApp provides decent support for its members.

## Final Verdict

EarnApp is a legitimate platform for passive income with good features and some limitations.

### Pros:
- Effortless earning
- Payments via PayPal and Wise
- Low payout threshold
- Global availability

### Cons:
- Low rewards
- App setup requires extra effort

If you're seeking easy extra cash, EarnApp is a solid option. Set realistic expectations—it's not for wealth, but patient users can earn decently with minimal effort.
